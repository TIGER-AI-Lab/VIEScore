The image also has noticeable artifacts, particularly around the face and the hands of the girl, as well as issues with the parrot's anatomy. The second image, although stylized, appears intentionally so and has fewer visible artifacts, hence a slightly higher score for naturalness but lower for artifacts due to text distortion and edges.",
