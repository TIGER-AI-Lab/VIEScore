The naturalness of the scene receives a 7 because the lighting and shadows are mostly convincing, and the books appear appropriately placed in relation to each other, suggesting a correct sense of distance.

The rendering quality is reminiscent of octane render techniques, with good detail and texture quality, contributing to a hyper-realistic look.
