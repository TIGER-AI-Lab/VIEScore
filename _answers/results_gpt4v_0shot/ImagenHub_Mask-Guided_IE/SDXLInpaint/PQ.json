The colors and lighting of the scene match reasonably well. However, the rocket's proximity and size relative to urban elements could evoke a slight unnatural feeling, as typically, such launches are not seen this close to public areas for safety reasons.Artifacts: The image has several issues. The rocket's smoke trail seems unnatural, with the smoke being too sharp and defined against the sky. The car on the left side appears to be cut off, which is unusual and implies an error in image composition. The shadow and the lighting on the clock tower's face seem inconsistent, especially the shadow cast on the ground which does not match the lighting direction as indicated by the rocket's shadow, and there are visible distortions in the tower's structure. Additionally, the flowers in the foreground seem overly saturated and somewhat artificial compared to the rest of the scene.",
