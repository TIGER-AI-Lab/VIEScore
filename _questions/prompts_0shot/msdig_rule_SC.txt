From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the first sub-image. 
(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject in the first sub-image at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject in the first sub-image.)
A third score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the second sub-image. 
(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject in the second sub-image at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject in the second sub-image.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2, score3], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the resemblance for the first sub-image, and 'score3' evaluates the resemblance for the second sub-image.
