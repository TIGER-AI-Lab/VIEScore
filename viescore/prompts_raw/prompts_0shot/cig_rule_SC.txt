From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the generated image is following the guidance image. 
(0 indicates that the second image is not following the guidance at all. 10 indicates that second image is following the guidance image.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the guidance.
