RULES of each set of inputs:

One image will be provided; The image is an AI-generated image.
The objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been generated.

From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on image naturalness. 
(
    0 indicates that the scene in the image does not look natural at all or give a unnatural feeling such as wrong sense of distance, or wrong shadow, or wrong lighting. 
    10 indicates that the image looks natural.
)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate the image artifacts. 
(
    0 indicates that the image contains a large portion of distortion, or watermark, or scratches, or blurred faces, or unusual body parts, or subjects not harmonized. 
    10 indicates the image has no artifacts.
)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [naturalness, artifacts]


First lets look at the first set of input (1st image) as an example. 
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [5, 5],
"reasoning" :  "The image gives an unnatural feeling on hands of the girl. There is also minor distortion on the eyes of the girl."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (2nd image).
