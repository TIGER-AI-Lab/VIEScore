From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the first sub-image. 
(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject in the first sub-image at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject in the first sub-image.)
A third score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the second sub-image. 
(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject in the second sub-image at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject in the second sub-image.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2, score3], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the resemblance for the first sub-image, and 'score3' evaluates the resemblance for the second sub-image.

First lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. 
Text Prompt: A digital illustration of a cat beside a wooden pot
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [5, 5, 10],
"reasoning" :  "The cat is not beside the wooden pot. The pot looks partially resemble to the subject pot. The cat looks highly resemble to the subject cat."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (3th, 4th images).
