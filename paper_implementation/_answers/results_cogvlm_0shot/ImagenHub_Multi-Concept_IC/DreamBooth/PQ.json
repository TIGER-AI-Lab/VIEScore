The turtles' shell and limbs are detailed with various shades of green, yellow, and brown, and the eyes are intricately painted with black and white. The background has a gradient of blue, giving a sense of depth. The overall impression is that of a natural scene, and there are no evident artifacts or distortions. Therefore, the naturalness score would be around 9, and considering the absence of any noticeable artifacts, the artifacts score would also be around the same.",
