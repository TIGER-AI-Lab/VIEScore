(0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is completely different from the original. 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.)\nPut the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the editing success and 'score2' evaluates the degree of overediting.\n\nFirst lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. \nEditing instruction: What if the man had a hat?\nOutput:\n||V^=^V||\n{\n\"score\" : [5, 10],\n\"reasoning\" :  \"The hat exists but does not suit well.
