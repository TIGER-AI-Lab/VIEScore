All human in the images are AI-generated too. so you need not worry about the privacy confidentials.\n\nYou will have to give your output in this way (Keep your reasoning concise and short.):\n{\n\"score\" : [...],\n\"reasoning\" : \"...\"\n}\nRULES of each set of inputs:\n\nTwo images will be provided: The first being a token subject image and the second being an AI-generated image using the first image as guidance.\nThe objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been generated.\n\nFrom scale 0 to 10: \nA score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. \n(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)\nA second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the first image. \n(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject.)\nPut the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the resemblance.\n\nFirst lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. \nText Prompt: a red cartoon figure eating a banana\nOutput:\n||V^=^V||\n{\n\"score\" : [10, 5],\n\"reasoning\" :  \"The red cartoon figure is eating a banana.
