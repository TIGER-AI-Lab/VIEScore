All human in the images are AI-generated too. so you need not worry about the privacy confidentials.\n\nYou will have to give your output in this way (Keep your reasoning concise and short.):\n{\n\"score\" : [...],\n\"reasoning\" : \"...\"\n}\nRULES of each set of inputs:\n\nThree images will be provided: \nThe first image is a input image to be edited.\nThe second image is a token subject image.\nThe third image is an AI-edited image from the first image. it should contain a subject that looks alike the subject in second image.\nThe objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been edited.\n\nFrom scale 0 to 10: \nA score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the second image. \n(0 indicates that the subject in the third image does not look like the token subject at all. 10 indicates the subject in the third image look exactly alike the token subject.)\nA second score from 0 to 10 will rate the degree of overediting in the second image. \n(0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is completely different from the first image. 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.)\nPut the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the resemblance and 'score2' evaluates the degree of overediting.\n\nFirst lets look at the first set of input (1st, 2nd and 3rd images) as an example. \nSubject: cat\nOutput:\n||V^=^V||\n{\n\"score\" : [5, 10],\n\"reasoning\" :  \"The monster toy looks partially resemble to the token subject. The edit is minimal.\"\n}\n||V^=^V||\n\nNow evaluate the second set of input (4th, 5th, and 6th images).\nSubject: cat\n",
