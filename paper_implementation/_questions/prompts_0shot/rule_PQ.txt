RULES:

The image is an AI-generated image.
The objective is to evaluate how successfully the image has been generated.

From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on image naturalness. 
(
    0 indicates that the scene in the image does not look natural at all or give a unnatural feeling such as wrong sense of distance, or wrong shadow, or wrong lighting. 
    10 indicates that the image looks natural.
)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate the image artifacts. 
(
    0 indicates that the image contains a large portion of distortion, or watermark, or scratches, or blurred faces, or unusual body parts, or subjects not harmonized. 
    10 indicates the image has no artifacts.
)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [naturalness, artifacts]
