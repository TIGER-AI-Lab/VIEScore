From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success of the editing. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image does not follow the editing instruction at all. 10 indicates that the scene in the edited image follow the editing instruction text perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate the degree of overediting in the second image. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is completely different from the original. 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the editing success and 'score2' evaluates the degree of overediting.
