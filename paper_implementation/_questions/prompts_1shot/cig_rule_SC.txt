From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the generated image is following the guidance image. 
(0 indicates that the second image is not following the guidance at all. 10 indicates that second image is following the guidance image.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the guidance.

First lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. 
Text Prompt: the bridge is red, Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco, USA
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [5, 5],
"reasoning" :  "The bridge is red. But half of the bridge is gone."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (3th, 4th images).
Text Prompt: <prompt>
