From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the second image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the second image follows the prompt perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate how well the subject in the generated image resemble to the token subject in the first image. 
(0 indicates that the subject in the second image does not look like the token subject at all. 10 indicates the subject in the second image look exactly alike the token subject.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the prompt and 'score2' evaluates the resemblance.

First lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. 
Text Prompt: a red cartoon figure eating a banana
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [10, 5],
"reasoning" :  "The red cartoon figure is eating a banana. The red cartoon figure looks partially resemble to the subject."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (3th, 4th images).
Text Prompt: <prompt>
