From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success in following the prompt. 
(0 indicates that the AI generated image does not follow the prompt at all. 10 indicates the AI generated image follows the prompt perfectly.)

Put the score in a list such that output score = [score].

First lets look at the first set of input (1st image) as an example. 
Text Prompt: A pink and a white frisbee are on the ground.
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [5],
"reasoning" :  "White frisbee not present in the image."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (2nd image).
Text Prompt: <prompt>
