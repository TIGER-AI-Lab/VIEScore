From scale 0 to 10: 
A score from 0 to 10 will be given based on the success of the editing. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image does not follow the editing instruction at all. 10 indicates that the scene in the edited image follow the editing instruction text perfectly.)
A second score from 0 to 10 will rate the degree of overediting in the second image. (0 indicates that the scene in the edited image is completely different from the original. 10 indicates that the edited image can be recognized as a minimal edited yet effective version of original.)
Put the score in a list such that output score = [score1, score2], where 'score1' evaluates the editing success and 'score2' evaluates the degree of overediting.

First lets look at the first set of input (1st and 2nd images) as an example. 
Editing instruction: What if the man had a hat?
Output:
||V^=^V||
{
"score" : [5, 10],
"reasoning" :  "The hat exists but does not suit well. The hat also looks distorted. But it is a good edit because only a hat is added and the background is persevered."
}
||V^=^V||

Now evaluate the second set of input (3th, 4th images).
Editing instruction: <instruction>
